  <h1>Place of <span id="b">birth</span> and family</h1>
  <p>Steven Paul Jobs was born on February 24, 1955 in San Francisco, California.
  His unwed biological parents, Joanne Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali, put him up for adoption. 
  Steve was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs, 
  a lower-middle-class couple, who moved to the suburban city of Mountain View a couple of years later.</p>

 <h1><span id="b">At age 13</span>, he met one the most important persons in his life</h1>
  <p>The Santa Clara county, south of the Bay Area, became known as Silicon Valley in the early 1950s after the sprouting of
  a myriad of semi-conductor companies. As a result, young Steve Jobs grew up in a neighborhood of engineers working on
  electronics and other gizmos in their garages on weekends. This shaped his interest in the field as he grew up.
  At age 13, he met one the most important persons in his life: 18-year-old Stephen Wozniak, an electronics wiz kid, and,
  like Steve, an incorrigible prankster.</p>

  <h1><span id="b">Five years later</span>, when Steve Jobs reached college age</h1>
  <p>Five years later, when Steve Jobs reached college age, he told his parents he wanted to enroll in Reed College 
  â€” an expensive liberal arts college up in Oregon. Even though the tuition fees were astronomical for the poor couple, 
  they had promised their son's biological parents he would get a college education, so they relented. Steve spent only 
  one semester at Reed, then dropped out, as he was more interested in eastern philosophy, fruitarian diets, and LSD than 
  in the classes he took. He moved to a hippie commune in Oregon where his main activity was cultivating apples.</p>

  <h1><span id="b">A few months later</span>, Steve returned to California</h1>
  <p>A few months later, Steve returned to California to look for a job. He was hired at the young video game maker Atari,
  and used his wages to make a trip to India with one of his college friends, in order to 'seek enlightenment'. He came 
  back a little disillusioned and started to take interest in his friend Woz's new activities.</p>
